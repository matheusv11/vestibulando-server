	Test many to many os prisma
	Use pivo tables on methods
	Exclusive url for pivo tables, to update relations after creation and not only in creation
	HandleErrors make sense? Only work for next methods and not for responses
	Destruct params on methods
	App.use(multer()) ?

	A good practice create direct on pivo table?
